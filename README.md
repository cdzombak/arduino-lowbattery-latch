# arduino-lowbattery-latch

Control a relay based on a "low battery" comparator signal.

I wrote this to retrofit into my [Ego battery based 12 volt power supply](https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2024/04/The-12v-portable-power-supply-Ego-needs-to-make.html). Previously, the "low battery" comparator drove the main power relay directly, which (predictably) resulted in flapping when the battery level was marginal. This Ardunio code implements the following logic:

- Check the battery level comparator 5 times at start to be sure the battery is not too low before powering on the main relay
- Check the battery level comparator every second and shut off the main relay if the battery's voltage is low 5 seconds in a row
- Illuminate a LED when the battery is low
- Once in the "low battery" state, put the Arduino into low power mode
- Once in the "low battery" state, stay there; the main relay and Arduino remain off until power is reset

## Hardware

This runs on an [Arduino Nano Every](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-every). I chose this due to its combination of:

- 5V supply & GPIO (meaning it's trivially compatible with my original circuit)
- small physical size
- low power consumption
- adequate GPIO pins
- ADC for possible future improved battery level monitoring

Notes:

- The odd comparator + microcontroller setup is simply because this was the easiest way to retrofit the Ardunio relay controller into [the original design](https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2024/04/The-12v-portable-power-supply-Ego-needs-to-make.html).
- The pull-up resistor marked `*` indicates I don't remember what value I used here; just pick something appropriate, maybe around 20 kÎ©, based on your relay's datasheet and the desire to minimize power consumption.
